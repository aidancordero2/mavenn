MAVE-NN: Quantitative modeling of genotype-pheontype maps for multpilex assays of variant effect (MAVEs)
=======================================================================================================

MAVE-NN enables the quantitative modeling of genotype-phenotype maps from the data produce by a wide variety of MAVEs, 
including deep mutational scanning (DMS) experiments and massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs).
This is acchieved by formulating the quantitative modeling problem as a neural network inference problem,
which is then solved using a TensorFlow back end. For an elaboration of this approach and its performance, 
please refer to our preprint:
