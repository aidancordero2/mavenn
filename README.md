MAVE-NN: genotype-phenotype maps from multiplex assays of variant effect
========================================================================

MAVE-NN enables the rapid quantitative modeling of genotype-phenotype (G-P) maps from the data produced by a wide variety of multiplex assays of variant effect (MAVEs). Such assays include deep mutational scanning (DMS) experiments on proteins and massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) on DNA or RNA regulatory sequences. MAVE-NN conceptualizes G-P map inference as a problem in information compression. MAVE-NN then solves this problem by training a neural network using TensorFlow.
