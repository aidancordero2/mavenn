MAVE-NN: learning genotype-phenotype maps from multiplex assays of variant effect
=================================================================================

MAVE-NN enables the rapid quantitative modeling of genotype-phenotype (G-P) maps from the data produced by a wide variety of multiplex assays of variant effect (MAVEs). Such assays including deep mutational scanning (DMS) experiments on proteins, and massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) on DNA or RNA regulatory sequences. MAVE-NN conceptualizes G-P map inference as a problem in information compression, which is then formulated as a neural network training problem and solved using a TensorFlow back end. For installation instructions, tutorials, and documentation, please refer to the MAVE-NN website, https://mavenn.readthedocs.io/.
