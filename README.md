MAVE-NN: Quantitative modeling of genotype-pheontype maps for multiplex assays of variant effect (MAVEs)
=======================================================================================================

MAVE-NN enables the quantitative modeling of genotype-phenotype (G-P) maps from the data produce by a wide variety of MAVEs, 
including deep mutational scanning (DMS) experiments on proteins, and massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) on
DNA or RNA regulatory sequences. This is acchieved by conceptualizing the G-P map inference problem as a problem in information compression, one that is then formulated as a neural network training problem, which is then solved using a TensorFlow back end. For an elaboration of this approach and its performance, please refer to our preprint:
