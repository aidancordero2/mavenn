I read this paper in more detail a few years ago. 

This has become the go-to reference for deep mutational scanning (in a way that my paper did not for for promoter scanning; I'm a little jelous). They mutagenized about 25 amino acids in a WW domain, did phage display, panned using a peptide that WW domains bind, and quantified the sequence-function relationship using fold enrichment. Results are consistent with previous studies on WW domains. There is no attempt to normalize for sequence-dependent expression from phage, though. }

This is the paper that has gotten the most attention for high-throughput in vitro measurements to TF binding specificities. Note: they fit a 5-th order Markov model to describe the different specificities they observed. I haven't yet red up on the details of this. Look at the references below. I'll have to read this in more depth later.

This seems to be the earliest application of SELEX with HT sequencing. They call the method HT-SELEX. Note that this differs from Spec-Seq (a 2014 publication) in 2 ways: here they sequence the bound fraction and initial library, and do a few rounds of SELEX. With Spec-Seq they sequence the bound and unbound fractions (not the library), and don't to any SELEX selection. This later procedure directly gives affinities without the need for any model fitting, which I particularly appreciate. One other difference is that the method described here used a 10xN randomized sequence, wheras the Spec-Seq method, as described, used only partially mutagenized sequences (so that binding sites remained alignable). 

Read (date unknown)

The main thing, I think, is that they can do 1-round SELEX with deep sequencing and get energy matrices from that. They use an explicit error model to fit emats to data, though, and I'm not sure how valid that assumption is. Still, I should show Anirban.

Describes SELEX-Seq. Seems to be basically the same as Spec-Seq. In particular, both methods use EMSA to separate bound complexes from unbound complexes. The main difference here is that these guys randomize 14 bp in their experiments, and have to fit a Markov model as a result. In the Stormo Spec-Seq paper, they randomize only a few internal position, and can therefore assume alignment.

The authors use HT-SELEX to profile the specificities of most human TFs (!). This greatly expands the specificity catalogue beyond what PBMs have achieved. Frankly, I don't see any reason to use PBMs over this method. Would be nice to start devling into their data.

Anyway, the experimental procedure is straight from Jolma (2010). Doesn't seem to be much terribly novel stuff going on with the binding site modeling. Here are some references they give for how people have approached the modeling problem:
(see, for example, Agius et al., 2010; Roulet et al., 2000; Sharon et al., 2008)}

Good quick review of the Spec-seq method. This is pretty much the simplest type of experiment to measure sequence specificity of TFs in a high-throughput manner. Has lots of references to HT-SELEX and SELEX-seq experiments. 

Says lac repressor was first TF identified. First instance of cooperative binding between two TFs was lambda repressor. 

Provides relative affinity measurements for thousands of sites in parallle. No nonlinear curve fitting. Can be used to measure cooperativity between two or more factors. Shows lac repressor has alternate modes of binding depending on binding site length. 

For in vitro measurements of cooperativeity, look at refs 42 and 43. These look very interesting! Read these next. }

Excellent early work on high-throughput SELEX that I'd missed until now. Good thing I caught this too, it's been cited {\textasciitilde}150 times! 

The SELEX procedure described here uses panning, not EMSA or affinity columns. It's optimized to assay lots of proteins at once. Wouldn't be surprised if there was some high-profile publication later on. Here they were assaying the specificities of 256 different TFs in a single sequencing run!

Very cool paper. They do something similar to what Tarjei did in living mouse liver! They use random mutagenesis with IDT oligos, random tagging + subassembly (ref 15), allowing them to assay mutagenized sequences as large as 620 bp! Thir modeling is very simple and only regression based. I should write to the 3 corresponding authors pointing out the ability to do much more complex model fitting.

Focuses on demonstrating that DNA shape contributions to binding specificity can be deconvolved from sequence contributions. Uses the SELEX-seq method of Slattery et al., 2011. Look at refrences below. Haven't yet read in detail, so can't fully appreciate how scientifically significant this is.

Some references on high-throughput binding assays: (Dror et al., 2014; Gorda{\^{ }} n et al., 2013; Lazarovici et al., 2013; Slattery et al., 2011; Yang et al., 2014)

Also: as more high- throughput DNA binding data become available (Hume et al., 2015; Jolma et al., 2013; Zhu et al., 2011),

Note: High-throughput DNA shape pre- dictions (Zhou et al., 2013)

Looks like useful reference too:

Bussemaker's editorial describing a special issue of Briefings in Functional Genomics. I just read Stormo's contribution, which is good. Other contributions that lookinteresting are by Noyes, by Morozov, by Siggers, and by Hughes. Hm.. Maybe I should just focus on reading these today. I'm very interested in getting caught up, in particular, on the bacterial one hybrid approch that Noyes uses. }

This sin't a bad paper. Their experimental methods probably won't be very useful to anyone as stated, and their analysis methods are primitive (no model fitting whatsoever). There sensitivity is also abysmal consiedering they're using Illumina sequencing.  But they do do a Sort-Seq-like experiment on eukaryotic promoters using HeLa cell nuclear extracts. I think I could design a similar experiment to do Sort-Seq on {\textasciitilde}150 bp sequences or more using a similar barcode method (barcoding each promoter with an mRNA-encoded tag). }

This is one of the first uses of high-throughput-SELEX-like methods. Not a bad paper, at least as far as the technique is described. Used a randomed 21bp region, so sequences are not alignable. 

Does not reference any prior high-throughput SELEX methods. 

21 bp randomized region. Analysis used MEME and custom Perl scripts. Incubated proteins with DNA at different concentrations. Tested both resin and EMSA methods of separating bound DNA from unbound DNA. }

Segal's version of Sort-Seq. Cites my paper once obliquely, but says nothing about the similarities of our approaches. Results are pure phenomenology. Advances over what I did:
- 2 color FACS, sort on ratio -{\&}gt; reduce noise
- Exploit stochastic resonance to make measurements, though they don't realize this.

Lamitudes:
- Cloning protocol is prone to multiple insertions
- Their barcode is in the fucking promoter DNA!
- No mathematical modeling at all
- Uses a lot of PCR; prone to chimeras and they present no evidence regarding this (I had a similar problem, though). }

Original paper descripting Spec-Seq. They obtain specificity profiles for three proteins: LacI, PurR, and Ycjw. Looks like I should be able to perform these experiments in my lab with ease. The introduction gives a valuable set of references. 

One major advantage of Spec-Seq is that it gives (relative) affinities without any model fitting or having to work in any saturation regime. The trick is to sequence the bound and unbound (not library) fractions. Then the affinity is given simply by the relative abundance in the bound vs. unbound fraciton, from the basic mass action equations. 

Note: I read this a while ago and found Figure 6 to be interesting. Also, their data is provided in the supplementary material. 

Refs for other high-throughput specificity assays: "current high-throughput methods that can de- termine specificity over thousands, or even millions, of sequences in parallel (Stormo and Zhao 2010), such as protein-binding microarrays (PBM) (Berger et al. 2006; Gor- dan et al. 2013), SELEX-seq [or HT-SELEX (Zhao et al. 2009; Zykovich et al. 2009; Jolma et al. 2010; Wong et al. 2011)], bacterial one-hybrid (B1H) (Meng et al. 2005; Noyes et al. 2008; Christensen et al. 2011), and mechanically induced trapping of molecular interactions (MITOMI) (Maerkl and Quake 2007)"

References for higher-order models:
Recent analyses of high-through- put data sets have explicitly considered higher-order models to account for nonadditive contributions (Slattery et al. 2011; Zhao et al. 2012; Weirauch et al. 2013; Orenstein and Shamir 2014) and they are beginning to populate motif repositories such as JASPAR (Mathelier and Wasserman 2013; Mathelier et al. 2014).}

Good summary. Would be better if it didn't completely ignore my 2010 paper.
