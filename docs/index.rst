MAVE-NN: Quantitative Modeling of Sequence-Function Relationships using Neural Networks
========================================================================================

MAVE-NN is a python package for inferring models of sequence-function relationships from 
multiplexed assays of variant effects (MAVEs). MAVE-NN currently uses global epistasis 
regression and noise agnostic regression. The :ref:`installation`, :ref:`quickstart`, 
:ref:`examples`, and :ref:`tutorial` sections below are provided to help users 
quickly get MAVE-NN working for their own research needs.

Installation
--------------

MAVE-NN has minimal dependencies and is compatible with both Python 2.7 and Python 3.6.
The code for MAVE-NN is available on `GitHub <https://github.com/jbkinney/mavenn>`_ under an MIT open source license.
mavenn can be installed from `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/logomaker/>`_ using the ``pip`` package manager by executing the following at the commandline: ::

    pip install mavenn

.. _quickstart:

Quick Start
-----------

For a quick demonstration of mavenn, execute the following within Python::

   import mavenn
   mavenn.demo()

Tutorial
--------

A tutorial is available via a series of Jupyter notebooks, each of which focuses on a 
different aspect of MAVE-NN's functionality. To view the notebooks statically on GitHub,
